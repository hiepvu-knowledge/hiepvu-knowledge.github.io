This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.</p> <p>I'm Neil.</p> <p>And I'm Sam.</p> <p>It's hard to feel positive when you hear about climate change, don't you think, Neil?</p> <p>Yes, according to the UN's Cop26 conference, we're heading for a catastrophic global temperature rise of three degrees by the end of this century...</p> <p>Fires are blazing from the Amazon to the Arctic...</p> <p>And even if we stopped burning all fossil fuels tomorrow, it would take decades to feel the effects.</p> <p>It's all very depressing!</p> <p>I agree, but there is hope that catastrophes can be avoided thanks to some amazing ideas by some very imaginative scientists.</p> <p>In this programme, we'll be discussing geoengineering - the name for a collection of new scientific plans to remove carbon from the atmosphere and stop global warming.</p> <p>Also called 'climate repair', geoengineering is still in the experimental stages.</p> <p>Some technologies are controversial because they interfere with natural climate systems, and others may not even be possible.</p> <p>One ingenious idea to cool the planet involves spraying diamond dust in the sky to deflect the Sun's rays.</p> <p>Amazing!</p> <p>But before we find out more, I have a question for you, Sam.</p> <p>Spraying diamond dust in the sky sounds futuristic, but in the 1960s there was a band who wrote a song called 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds'.</p> <p>But which band?</p> <p>Was it: a) The Rolling Stones? b) The Beach Boys? or c) The Beatles?</p> <p>I think most people would say the answer is c) The Beatles.</p> <p>OK, we'll find out the answer later in the programme.</p> <p>Now, throwing diamonds in the sky might sound crazy but it's far from the wildest idea scientists have thought up to decarbonise the planet.</p> <p>Oceans hold sixteen times more carbon than the Earth's atmosphere and could hold even more if the fish and plankton living there had more available nutrients - food that animals and plants need to grow.</p> <p>But how to provide these nutrients?</p> <p>Believe it or not, one answer involves - you guessed it - whale poo!</p> <p>David King chairs the Centre for Climate Repair at Cambridge University.</p> <p>He explained how his unusual idea would work to BBC World Service programme, Discovery:</p> <p>Imagine now a pod of whales all coming up and pooing in the same area of the ocean.</p> <p>This could be in an eddy current, and it could lead to something like 10,000 to 20,000 square kilometres being covered in nutrients, including iron.</p> <p>And as we know from observations today, within three months that region is chock-a-block with fish.</p> <p>Whales live in groups called pods.</p> <p>They swim up to the ocean surface to poo, and this poo can be spread in an eddy - a large current of water moving in a circular motion, like a giant whirlpool.</p> <p>As a result, huge areas of the ocean are covered in nutrients, and become chock-a-block with fish - an informal way to say 'full of fish'.</p> <p>Another original idea being explored is 'rock weathering'.</p> <p>Carbon is slowly locked into rocks and mountains over thousands of years by natural geological processes.</p> <p>This literally ground-breaking idea would speed up the process by locking carbon into rocks that have been dug up through industrial mining.</p> <p>Listen as geochemist, Professor Rachael James, explains her idea to BBC World Service's, Discovery:</p> <p>For every tonne of rock that's mined, only a very tiny proportion, a couple of grams of that, is actually diamond.</p> <p>The rest of it is effectively waste.</p> <p>So, mine waste material is potentially a really great source of material that could be repurposed for enhanced rock weathering and I think that's really good because it creates a circular economy.</p> <p>Mining for diamonds creates tonnes of waste rock which could be used to capture carbon.</p> <p>Professor James wants to repurpose this rock - to find a new use for it.</p> <p>Not only would this lock more carbon, it also creates a circular economy - an economic model which involves sharing, reusing and recycling products for as long as possible to avoid waste and to reduce levels of carbon.</p> <p>While these ideas might sound strange, they're all theoretically possible.</p> <p>And looking to science for positive solutions reminds some people of the early ecological movement which started in the 1960s and now, fifty years later, is being taken seriously.</p> <p>Speaking of the 1960s, it's time to reveal the answer to my question, Sam.</p> <p>Ah yes, you asked me which sixties band wrote the song, 'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds'.</p> <p>I said, confidently, c) The Beatles.</p> <p>Which was, of course... the correct answer!</p> <p>John Lennon and Paul McCartney wrote the song in 1967 but I doubt even they could have predicted that it would inspire a scientific idea to save the planet!</p> <p>OK, let's recap the vocabulary from the programme, starting with nutrients - food that plants and animals need to grow.</p> <p>Whales and other sea mammals like dolphins live in a group called 'a pod'.</p> <p>An eddy is a large current of water moving in a circular motion.</p> <p>Chock-a-block is an informal way to say 'full of something'.</p> <p>If you 'repurpose' something, you find a new use for it - a use other than what was originally intended.</p> <p>And finally, the planet's future might depend on the circular economy - an economic system which values sharing, reusing and recycling over consumption and waste.</p> <p>These incredible scientific innovations might mean that time is not yet up for planet Earth - but time is up for this programme.</p> <p>Join us again soon for more trending topics and related vocabulary here at 6 Minute English.</p> <p>Goodbye for now!</p>

1","text":"<p>Test 4 - READING | READING PASSAGE 1 You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 1-13,  which are based on Reading Passage 1 below.  Roman tunnels </p> <p>The Persians, who lived in present-day Iran, were one of the first civilizations to build tunnels that provided a reliable supply of water to human settlements in dry areas. In the early first millennium BCE, they introduced the qanat method of tunnel construction, which consisted of placing posts over a hill in a straight line, to ensure that the turmel kept to its route, and then digging vertical shafts down into the ground at regular intervals. Underground, workers removed the earth from between the ends of the shafts, creating a tunnel. The excavated soil was taken up to the surface using the shafts, which also provided ventilation during the work. Once the tunnel was completed, it allowed water to flow from the top of a hillside down towards a canal, which supplied water for human use. Remarkably, some qanats built by the Persians 2,700 years ago are still in use today.</p> <p>They later passed on their knowledge to the Romans, who also used the qanat method to construct water-supply tunnels for agriculture. Roman qanat tunnels were constructed with vertical shafts dug at intervals of between 30 and 60 meters. The shafts were equipped with handholds and footholds to help those climbing in and out of them and were covered with a wooden or stone lid. To ensure that the shafts were vertical, Romans hung a plumb line from a rod placed across the top of each shaft and made sure that the weight at the end of it hung in the center of the shaft. Plumb lines were also used to measure the depth of the shaft and to detennine the slope of the tunnel. The 5.6-kilometer-long Claudius tunnel, built in 4l CE to drain the Fucine Lake in central Italy, had shafts that were up to 122 meters deep, took ll years to build and involved approximately 30,000 workers.</p> <p>By the 6th century BCE, a second method of tunnel construction appeared called the counterexcavation method, in which the tunnel was constructed from both ends. It was used to cut through high mountains when the qanat method was not a practical \u2018alternative. This method required greater planning and advanced knowledge of surveying, mathematics and geometry as both ends of a tunnel had to meet correctly at the center of the mountain. Adjustments to the direction of the tunnel also had to be made whenever builders encountered geological problems or when it deviated from its set path. They constantly checked the tunnel\u2019s advancing direction,</p> <p>For example, by looking back at the light that penetrated through the tunnel mouth, and made corrections whenever necessary. Large deviations could happen, and they could result in one end of the tunnel not being usable. An inscription written on the side of a 428-meter tunnel, built by the Romans as part of the Saldae aqueduct system in modern-day Algeria, describes how the two teams of builders missed each other in the mountain and how the later construction of a lateral link between both corridors corrected the initial error.</p> <p>The Romans dug tunnels for their roads using the counter-excavation method, whenever they encountered obstacles such as hills or mountains that were too high for roads to pass over. An example is the 37-meter-long, 6-meter-high, Furlo Pass Tunnel built in Italy in 69\u201479 CE. Remarkably, a modern road still uses this tunnel today. Tunnels were also built for mineral extraction. Miners would locate a mineral vein and then pursue it with shafts and tunnels underground. Traces of such tunnels used to mine gold can still be found at the Dolaucothi mines in Wales. When the sole purpose of a tunnel was mineral extraction, construction required less plarming, as the tunnel route was determined by the mineral vein.</p> <p>Roman tunnel projects were carefully planned and carried out. The length of time it took to construct a tunnel depended on the method being used and the type of rock being excavated. The qanat construction method was usually faster than the counter-excavation method as it was more straightforward. This was because the mountain could be excavated not only from the tunnel mouths but also from shafts. The type of rock could also influence construction times. When the rock was hard, the Romans employed a technique called fire quenching which consisted of heating the rock with fire, and then suddenly cooling it with cold Water so that it would crack. Progress through hard rock could be very slow, and it was not uncommon for tunnels to take years, if not decades, to be built. Construction marks left on a Roman tunnel in Bologna show that the rate of advance through solid rock was 30 centimeters per day. In contrast, the rate of advance of the Claudius tunnel can be calculated at 1.4 meters per day. Most tunnels had inscriptions showing the names of patrons who ordered construction and sometimes the name of the architect. For example, the 1.4-kilometer Cevlik tunnel in Turkey, built to divert the floodwater threatening the harbor of the ancient city of Seleuceia Pieria, had inscriptions on the entrance, still visible today, that also indicate that the tunnel was started in 69 CE and was completed in 81 CE.</p>"},{"location":"mess/C15.T1.T1.1/","title":"C15.T1.T1.1","text":"<p>Hello William. This is Amber - you said to phone if I wanted to get more information about the job agency you mentioned. Is now a good time? Oh, hi Amber. Yes. Fine. So the agency I was talking about is called Bankside - they're based in Docklands - I can tell you the address now - 497 Eastside. OK, thanks. So is there anyone in particular I should speak to there? The agent I always deal with is called Becky Jamieson. Let me write that down - Becky\u2026 Jamieson Jamieson Do you have her direct line? Yes, it's in my contacts somewhere - right, here we are: 07866510333. I wouldn't call her until the afternoon if I were you - she's always really busy in the morning trying to fill last-minute vacancies. She's really helpful and friendly so I'm sure it would be worth getting in touch with her for an informal chat. It's mainly clerical and admin jobs they deal with, isn't it? That's right. I know you're hoping to find a full-time job in the media eventually - but Becky mostly recruits temporary staff for the finance sector - which will look good on your CV - and generally pays better too. Yeah - I'm just a bit worried because I don't have much office experience. I wouldn't worry. They'll probably start you as a receptionist, or something like that. So what's important for that kind of job isn't so much having business skills or knowing lots of different computer systems - it's communication that really matters - so you'd be fine there. And you'll pick up office skills really quickly on the job. It's not that complicated. OK good. So how long do people generally need temporary staff for? It would be great if I could get something lasting at least a month. That shouldn't be too difficult. But you're more likely to be offered something for a week at first, which might get extended. It's unusual to be sent somewhere for just a day or two. Right, I've heard the pay isn't too bad - better than working in a shop or a restaurant. Oh yes - definitely. The hourly rate is about \u00a310, 11 if you're lucky. That's pretty good. I was only expecting to get eight or nine pounds an hour. Do you want me to tell you anything about the registration process? Yes, please. I know you have to have an interview. The interview usually takes about an hour and you should arrange that about a week in advance. I suppose I should dress smartly if it's for office work - I can probably borrow a suit from Mum. Good idea. It's better to look too smart than too casual. Will I need to bring copies of my exam certificates or anything like that? No - they don't need to see those, I don't think. What about my passport? Oh yes - they will ask to see that. OK. I wouldn't get stressed about the interview though. It's just a chance for them to build relationship with you - so they can try and match you to a job which you'll like. So there are questions about personality that they always ask candidates - fairly basic ones. And they probably won't ask anything too difficult like what your plans are for the future. Hope not. Anyway, there are lots of benefits to using an agency - for example, the interview will be useful because they'll give you feedback on your performance so you can improve next time. And they'll have access to jobs which aren't advertised. Exactly - most temporary jobs aren't advertised. And I expect finding a temporary job this way takes a lot less time - it's much easier than ringing up individual companies. Yes indeed.
